# BeyondGrammar for Froala with React
Bring real-time spelling, grammar and style checking into your Froala editor. Perfect for CMSs, help desk systems and blogs.

To add real-time grammar, spell and style checking to your Froala editor you just need to install this add-in. It's free for individuals and reasonably proced for multi-user licenses.

## Purpose of this sample
The code in this repository is a duplicate of the one in the official <a href="https://github.com/froala/react-froala-wysiwyg" target="_blank">Froala</a> one. It is intended to show how to integrate BeyondGrammar with the Froala React code.

In the "Full Featured Example" demo page we added BeyondGrammar with a very simple configuration (please make sure you add your BeyondGrammar API key to the code first).

All changes to the original code are identified in comments using a [pwa] tag. The changes where kept to a minimum to highlight only the integration.
